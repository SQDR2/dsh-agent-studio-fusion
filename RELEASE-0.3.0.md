# dsh-fusion 0.3.0

This is the first release under the name `dsh-fusion`. It is a fork of
[`aa2246740/dsh-model-fusion`](https://github.com/aa2246740/dsh-model-fusion), and 0.2.9 is the upstream release it
builds on. Everything upstream does is still here; the changes below are the fork's.

The package was renamed from `dsh-model-fusion`, so install `dsh-fusion` once — an installed `dsh-model-fusion` is not
upgraded in place. The plugin adopts its existing state on first start (see Compatibility).

## Changes

- The Fusion entry moved from **Settings → Fusion** to its own left-sidebar panel, and the panel body scrolls inside the
  main slot instead of clipping the form and history table on a short window.
- A role on a bridge route (`antigravity`, i.e. `dsh-agy-worker` / `dsh-agy-link`) can now reach the Host tools. That
  route may only report a step as `agy_tool`, which the role ceiling never carried, so a delegation degraded to prose and
  the Host reported `WORKER_TOOLS_UNREACHABLE`. The transport is unioned into the ceiling when this Host registers it,
  for the Lead as well as the Sidekick.
- A bridged Sidekick can now bind its brief and report back. Such a route runs the call in its own loop under a
  bridge-local id, so `fusion_submit_result` was refused as "Worker tool requires a complete native model request" and
  the task stalled. A bridged call is accepted for the message that emitted the transport; the native path is unchanged
  and still preferred.
- A task whose Sidekick route cannot reach the tools at all has an exit: the verdict is recorded on the runtime record,
  `fusion_wait` re-reports it, and `fusion_delegate` may replace the dead order instead of leaving the task in
  `WORKER_RUNNING` with no way out.
- A frozen scope no longer deadlocks a task. A glob such as `allowedPaths: ['lib/types/**']` matched nothing, widening
  was refused because the files it wanted to record already differed, and the scope could not be cleared. Globs match,
  widening is compared against the delegation base, and the scope can be cleared explicitly.
- History records can be deleted again. Deletion now asks the coordinator, which is the only authority that sees live
  Agents, tool calls, jobs and write leases, so a replaced process no longer leaves an undeletable `running` task and a
  live task is no longer deleted out from under itself. A 409 names the resource that held it.
- Usage, the task list, cache keepalive and history are each a collapsible box, collapsed by default, so the model pair
  stays above the fold.

## Compatibility after the rename

- Message source kinds are read under both spellings (`plugin:dsh-fusion`, `plugin:dsh-model-fusion`) and written only
  under the new one. Recorded history is never rewritten.
- A session that selected Fusion before the rename stored `dsh-model-fusion/auto`; it is rewritten to `dsh-fusion/auto`
  when the plugin installs its selection, so the next turn dispatches under a registered provider.
- `$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-model-fusion/` is migrated to `$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-fusion/` on first start, with a
  copy fallback across filesystems that removes only the files it copied.
- Durable write leases are adopted the same way, and a lock written under the old name still blocks a new writer rather
  than being taken over.
- The panel's HTTP routes are now `/api/fusion`; `/api/model-fusion` stays registered for a browser tab still holding the
  previous client bundle.

## Validation

Type checking passes, all 379 unit tests pass, and `lib/` was rebuilt from the tagged source. The native Host suite passes
263 tests with one Windows-only test skipped, on the pinned Host checkout. No model calls were made for this release, and
the plugin is not installed or activated in a running Host by this preparation.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:SQDR2/dsh-fusion#v0.3.0
